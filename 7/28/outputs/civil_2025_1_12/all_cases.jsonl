The appellant appealed, arguing that the respondents waived their right to arbitration by filing a detailed written statement without a Section 8 application under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The appellant also contended that the nominated arbitrator (a respondent's official) was impermissible. The respondents argued that the written statement raised the arbitration clause, fulfilling Section 8's requirements.  The court examined Section 8 of the Act, relevant Supreme Court and High Court judgments (including Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. and P. Anand Gajapathi Raju cases), and determined that while the respondents raised the arbitration clause in their written statement, a formal Section 8 application was missing.  However, the court found that raising the arbitration clause in the written statement, coupled with objections to the trial court's jurisdiction, sufficed to trigger the mandatory arbitration referral under Section 8.

In 2011, a government committee recommended his premature retirement under Article 226(2) of the J&K Civil Services Regulations, 1956, citing this incident.

Bhat challenged this order, arguing it was arbitrary.", "Reasoning & Background": "The High Court reviewed the legality of the premature retirement under Article 226(2) of the J&K Civil Services Regulations, 1956.  The court examined previous case law emphasizing that the government must consider the entire service record, including both positive and negative aspects, before making such a decision.  The court found that the government's decision relied primarily on the pending bribery case and did not adequately consider Bhat's overall service record, which was largely positive. The court noted that a pending case, even involving bribery, doesn't automatically justify premature retirement, especially without other adverse material in the service record. The High Court referred to Supreme Court judgments in “State of Gujrat vs Suryakant Chunilal Shah”, (1991) 1 SCC 529, Baikunta Nath Das vs Chief District Medical Officer, AIR 1992 SC 1020, and a Division Bench judgment of the J&K High Court in State of J&K and Others vs. Janak Singh, 2010 (4) JKJ 89 (HC), to support its reasoning.", "Verdict Results": "The High Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the single judge's decision to quash the government's order of premature retirement.

Respondent 1 had paid Rs. 10,00,000 as token money but the land did not belong to the defendants.  Appellant issued a cheque for Rs. 10,00,000 which bounced due to insufficient funds. The suit was filed under Order 37 CPC.", "Reasoning & Background": "The appellant challenged the trial court's judgment which declined his application for leave to defend the suit.  The court examined Order 37 CPC, particularly Rule 2 and 3,  and relevant case laws from the Supreme Court regarding the grant of leave to defend in summary suits. The court noted that the appellant admitted issuing the cheque but claimed it was given to defendant 2 for bank account purposes. The court found no credible evidence supporting this claim.", "Verdict Results": "The appeal was dismissed. The court found no error in the trial court's decision to deny the appellant leave to defend and grant the decree in favor of the respondent. The amount deposited by the appellant was ordered to be returned with interest.", "Relevant Statutes": ["Order 37 CPC: Deals with summary procedure in suits on promissory notes, bills of exchange, and hundis.

{"instruction": "Extract the four sections from this judgment.", "question": "Parse the judgment text of 'RFA/12/2025 of ABDUL HAMID KALOO Vs RANBIR SINGH TULA  AND ORS'.", "answer": {"Judgment Facts": "The appellant filed a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell dated April 19, 2004, and a supplementary agreement dated August 31, 2005, concerning 1 kanal of land.  The appellant claimed possession based on payment of Rs. 5.00 lacs and a further Rs. 5.75 lacs as per the supplementary agreement.  Defendants 5-7, subsequent owners, applied under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC, arguing the land was migrant property under the Jammu and Kashmir Migrant Property (Preservation, Protection and Restraint on Distress Sales) Act, 1997, and that the suit was barred by this Act and by limitation.", "Reasoning & Background": "The court considered whether the trial court correctly dismissed the suit under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC.  The court reviewed the agreements to sell, noting the lack of a specific performance date in the initial agreement, but the existence of a one-month deadline in the supplementary agreement (August 31, 2005).  The court found that the suit, filed on October 31, 2012, was filed more than seven years after the deadline and thus barred by limitation (Article 84 of the J&K Limitation Act).  The court also held that consideration of whether defendants 5-7 were registered migrants was not necessary at this stage as the suit was already barred by limitation.", "Verdict Results": "The appeal was dismissed. The court upheld the trial court's decision to dismiss the suit on the grounds that it was barred by limitation.", "Relevant Statutes": ["Order 7 Rule 11 CPC: Pertains to rejection of plaints based on lack of cause of action or statutory bar.", "Jammu and Kashmir Migrant Property (Preservation, Protection and Restraint on Distress Sales) Act, 1997: Governs migrant property and potentially affects the legality of the land sale.", "Article 84 of the first Schedule of the J&K Limitation Act: Specifies the three-year limitation period for suits for specific performance of contracts."]}, "metadata": {"court_code": "1~12", "title": "RFA/12/2025 of ABDUL HAMID KALOO Vs RANBIR SINGH TULA  AND ORS", "description": "Regular List IN THE HIGH COURT OF JAMMU & KASHMIR AND LADAKH AT SRINAGAR RFA No.12/2025 CM No.652/2025 Caveat No.96/2025 ABDUL HAMID KALOO …Petitioner(s) Through: Mr. Ahmad Javid, Advocate.

These were not addressed, leading to a writ petition (SWP No. 925/1998). The court ordered their encadrement.  A subsequent appeal was dismissed.  Although encadred retrospectively from their transfer date, they received only notional pay fixation and pension benefits, not full monetary benefits.  They then filed SWP No. 2312/2014 challenging this, leading to the impugned judgment which is appealed here.", "Reasoning & Background": "The appellant argued that the \"No Work No Pay\" principle applied because the respondents hadn't worked in the secretariat cadre before the encadrement.  The appellant also argued that the Writ Court's analogy to similarly situated individuals was incorrect.  The court found the Writ Court's judgment legally sound. The respondents, despite repeated requests, were not encadred in the Secretariat service, although similarly situated individuals were. They performed duties akin to those in the higher pay grade in the Civil Secretariat, from their transfer date. The court rejected the \"No Work No Pay\" argument because the respondents continuously performed their duties after their transfer.  The court held that once the encadrement was accepted retrospectively, denying monetary benefits was unjustified.", "Verdict Results": "The appeal is dismissed. The court upholds the Writ Court's judgment, finding no legal infirmity.

Defendant No. 1, Rehman Dar, died after appearing in court and filing a written statement.  The plaintiffs (petitioners in this revision petition) learned of the death but the court record only reflected the death when the deceased defendant's counsel reported it in October 2016 (death occurred in March 2016).  The plaintiffs applied to bring the legal representatives of the deceased defendant on record and for condonation of delay. The trial court allowed the application, and the petitioners challenged this order in an appeal which was dismissed.

The court notes a duty is cast upon counsel to inform the court of a litigant's death (Order 22 Rule 10-A Code of Civil Procedure Svt., 1977). The court finds that the death was notified in October 2016, and six months later, the plaintiffs acted. Thus, there was no undue delay. The court finds the trial court's order legally sound and not warranting interference under section 115 of the J&K Code of Civil Procedure.
